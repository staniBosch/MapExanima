How-To:
1. Start the game in window-mode (fullscreen not supported yet)
2. Begin/Continue ingame
3. Start the app


Modify Maps:
You can add icons, markers [...] to the [IDX]Map_Y.[png] files found in the folder Maps.


Special-Thanks goes to:

-Vismel@Steam for the Catacombs Map
-Frostdemon727@reddit for the Market Map
-Tspoon@Steam for the Archive Map and for the impulse to create the whole app



!Attention!

This App reads the memory of Exanima. 
In the (near) future it could result in a ban if they release something like a Multiplayer. 
But at the moment nothing should happen.
