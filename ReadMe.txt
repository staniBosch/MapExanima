Introduction

Map for Exanima. Drag the Map with both left and right mouse-button pressed.
Double click to enlarge the map.

!Attention!

This App reads the memory of Exanima. 
In the (near) future it could result in a ban if they release something like a Multiplayer. 
But at the moment it should be safe.

!Attention!
